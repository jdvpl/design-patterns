## Creational Patterns

Creational patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by controlling the object creation process.

Examples of creational design patterns include:
- Singleton
- Factory Method
- Abstract Factory
- Builder
- Prototype
